## ‚úÖ Recently Completed (Current Session)

### Frontend Integration & UX

- [x] **FIXED: Message sending with file attachments** ‚≠ê **NEW**

  - Added backend API call to save user messages with file references to MongoDB
  - Files are uploaded to GridFS, then message is saved with file metadata
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/app/app.tsx` lines 458-499

- [x] **FIXED: Chat creation in backend** ‚≠ê **NEW**

  - New chats are now created in MongoDB backend when first message is sent
  - Ensures chat exists before messages are saved
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/app/app.tsx` lines 556-582

- [x] **FIXED: Assistant message persistence** ‚≠ê **NEW**

  - Assistant messages are now saved to MongoDB after streaming completes
  - Ensures both user and assistant messages with metadata are persisted
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/app/app.tsx` lines 652-713

- [x] **Enabled attachment button in InputArea**

  - Changed `showAttachmentButton` from false to true in app.tsx
  - File upload UI now accessible to users
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/app/app.tsx` line 1249

- [x] **Added file upload progress indicators**

  - Added progress state: `uploadProgress` (Record<string, number>) and `isUploading` (boolean)
  - Integrated LinearProgress for per-file progress bars
  - Integrated CircularProgress for overall upload status
  - Visual feedback during upload with progress bars per file
  - Disabled send button during upload (canSend logic updated)
  - Files shown with reduced opacity during upload
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/components/InputArea.tsx`

- [x] **Fixed file attachment display in ChatArea**

  - Added Chip import from Material-UI
  - File chips already implemented with file icons, names, sizes
  - Download functionality via click and delete icon
  - Integrated with getFileIcon helper for proper icon display
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/components/ChatArea.tsx`

- [x] **Connected ChatArea to backend**

  - Passed `authToken` prop to ChatArea for authenticated downloads
  - Passed `currentChatId` prop for context
  - Download functionality already implemented via `downloadFile` service
  - handleFileDownload calls backend API with auth token
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/app/app.tsx` line 1224-1225

- [x] **Added internationalization for file messages**

  - Added file-related translations to English, Arabic, and Hebrew
  - New translation keys:
    - `input.uploadingFiles`: "Uploading files..."
    - `input.fileUploadError`: "Failed to upload files"
    - `input.fileUploadSuccess`: "Files uploaded successfully"
    - `input.removeFile`: "Remove file"
    - `input.dropFilesHere`: "Drop files here"
    - `input.maxFileSize`: "Maximum file size: {{size}}"
    - `input.maxFileCount`: "Maximum {{count}} files allowed"
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/i18n/translations/*.ts`

- [x] **Updated Message type to include files**

  - Added `FileAttachment` interface to stream-mocks library
  - Added `files?: FileAttachment[]` field to Message interface
  - Ensures type safety across frontend and message handling
  - Location: `libs/stream-mocks/src/lib/stream-mocks.ts`

- [x] **File upload flow integration**
  - Files are uploaded to backend before message is sent
  - Upload happens in `handleSendMessage` function
  - File metadata returned from backend is converted to FileAttachment format
  - Attachments added to user message before displaying
  - Error handling catches upload failures and prevents message send
  - Location: `apps/frontend/src/app/app.tsx` lines 402-428

## üîß Technical Details

### File Storage Strategy

#### MongoDB Mode (Production)

- **Storage:** GridFS (MongoDB)
- **Advantages:** Scalable, persistent, supports large files
- **Implementation:** `GridFSBucket` in chat service

#### Demo Mode

- **Storage:** Base64 in memory
- **Advantages:** No database required, easy testing
- **Limitations:** High memory usage, not persistent
- **Implementation:** In-memory Map in chat service

### File Upload Flow

```
User selects file(s) in InputArea
    ‚Üì
Frontend validation (size, count, type)
    ‚Üì
User types message and clicks send
    ‚Üì
Upload files to backend API (POST /api/chats/:chatId/files)
    ‚Üì
Backend stores files in GridFS/base64
    ‚Üì
Backend returns file metadata
    ‚Üì
Frontend creates user message with file attachments
    ‚Üì
**Frontend saves user message to MongoDB (POST /api/chats/:chatId/messages)** ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Frontend streams assistant response
    ‚Üì
**Frontend saves assistant message to MongoDB after streaming** ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Frontend displays messages with file attachments
```

### Configuration

**Backend:**

- Max file size per request: 10 files
- Storage bucket name: 'uploads'
- Demo mode env: `DEMO_MODE=true`

**Frontend:**

- Max file size: 5MB (`FILE_UPLOAD_CONFIG.MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- Max total size: 50MB (`FILE_UPLOAD_CONFIG.MAX_TOTAL_SIZE`)
- Max file count: 8 (`FILE_UPLOAD_CONFIG.MAX_FILE_COUNT`)
- Accepted types: All (empty array = all types accepted)
